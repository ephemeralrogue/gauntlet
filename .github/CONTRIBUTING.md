# Contribution Guidelines

This project utilizes a [Trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) approach, emphasizing the use of forks.

## To begin working on an issue

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch that branches off of `main`
3. Maintain open discussion regarding the issue you are working on
4. Keep your fork's main branch in sync with the upstream main branch; keep
your development branch updated with the latest changes as well
5. Document everything

## Submitting a PR

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR):

1. Pull the latest changes from the upstream `main` branch into your feature
branch and resolve any merge conflicts
2. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` to include a short description of your changes in
the next version
3. Run linting scripts and fix any issues that arise
4. Double check that your documentation is complete
5. In GitHub, open a pull request to merge your development branch from your
fork into the upstream repo's `main`
